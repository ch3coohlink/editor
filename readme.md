## What is this
I write random stuff here.
visit `ch3coohlink.github.io/editor/index.html?load=<target_path>` to run these demo, e.g: `ch3coohlink.github.io/editor/index.html?load=gui-test/01 - 1 level octree.js`
## How to dev
Make sure you have nodejs and npm installed.
1. install dev dependencies by `npm i`
2. boot dev server `node ./server.js`
3. visit `localhost:9999/dev.html?load=<target_path>`
e.g: `localhost:9999/dev.html?load=gui-test/01 - 1 level octree.js`
